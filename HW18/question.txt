At a convolutional layer, given that 


x=[12 14 15 17;
      34 56 73 32;
      67 43 31 21;
       32 31 43 56]


w=[-1   0
        0   -1]


b=0.3


dy= [-2 3 4;
         -1 5 3;
         2 3 4]


Compute updated 'b' and 'w' in the current layer. [0.5 marks]
Compute 'dy' for the next layer (in the backward direction) [0.5 marks]


Assume learning rate as 0.1

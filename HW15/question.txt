Try to make some changes in the LeNet architecture such that its test performance increases on MNIST dataset. You can use python/matlab libraries. You can consider changing the following:
i) Filter size
ii) Stride
iii) Pooling technique. For example, you can try pooling by computing the "determinant" value.
iv) Activation function. For example, you can try out some new activation functions like "x*sigmoid(x)".
v) Number of layers
vi) Number of filters

Please compare the performance of your modified LeNet and the original one. Clearly state what are your modifications.

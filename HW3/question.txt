Answer any one of the following:

1) Collect two videos: one with a mostly static object and another with a mostly dynamic object. Subtract Mean, Median and Mode Frames from each of the frames to perform background subtraction. 
[0.25 for collecting/making good videos; 
0.45 for computing the mean, median, mode frames; 
0.3 for successfully performing the background subtraction using the three approaches] 

2) Compute saliency map for any color image using both color and spatial distances of the pixels as discussed in the class. 

Trust me these homeworks will be very beneficial for you in this course. These will serve as foundations for what you are going to build in the future. 

As requested, attaching one mostly dynamic video as a sample.
